# Calculating-Free-to-Paid-Conversion-Rate-with-SQL-and-Python
to estimate the fraction of students who purchase a subscription after starting a lecture, i.e., the free-to-paid conversion rate among students who’ve engaged with video content on the 365 platform. You will also be tasked with calculating several other key metrics and analyzing the results.

The data you’ll be working with includes three tables storing information about students’ registration dates, engagement dates, and subscription purchase dates.
The task is to find out 
. What is the free-to-paid conversion rate of students who have watched a lecture on the 365 platform?
. What is the average duration between the registration date and when a student has watched a lecture for the first time (date of first-time engagement)?
. What is the average duration between the date of first-time engagement and when a student purchases a subscription for the first time (date of first-time purchase)?
. How can we interpret these results, and what are their implications?
